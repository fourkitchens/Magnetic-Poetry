The h5bp build script based on ant has been ported to use node as a build tool.

There was a first attempt using cake and coffeescript to do that. This
port has been itself ported to use grunt instead. Here we'll go through
grunt usage and the h5bp build script documentation based on it.

## Features

Does the following things (not necessarily in the same order):

* Concats / Compresses JS
* Concats / Compresses CSS
* Inlice CSS imports
* Renames JS/CSS to prepend a hash of their contents for easier versioning
* Does the necessary regex replacements in html files and templates
* Retriggers the build script on file changes (watch mode &#10084;)
* Automatically reload the page in your browsers whenever watched files change, through some socket.io magic.

## Requirements

In order to successfully use this you will need:

* node <= 0.6.7
* npm

You should be able to use it on:

* OSX
* Unix
* Windows (watched files need further work, but we'll get there)

## Install instructions

Install can be done in a few different ways, pick the one that suits you
best.

### git clone / npm install

Clone or download this repo. Then, `cd` into it and run the `npm
install` command.

    # will most likely change to map the new location / repo / branch
    git clone git://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script.git

    # install the dependencies
    # locally to play with it from the repo
    npm install

    # or globally, to install the h5bp binary
    npm install -g

### npm install tar.gz

Note that all of these can be shorten to one single command, very much
like if it was published on npm. Append a `-g` flag if you'd like to
install globally and have the h5bp binary installed.

    npm install https://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script/tarball/master

Proxies don't like redirections, if you get problem with this command, try
this instead:

    npm install http://nodeload.github.com/h5bp/node-build-script/tarball/master

### Download the build script with all dependencies built-in

*(todo)* In order to get you started even easily, there's a special
branch with all the node_modules installed and commited in the
repository.

Note that this is provided mainly as a conveniency, if you get problem
installing the dependencies through `npm install`. But really, the
recommanded way to grab the dependencies is through npm usage.

##### Uninstall


You may want to uninstall the globally installed package by running the
following command:

    npm uninstall html5-boilerplate -g

## Usage

Once installed and everything setup, you'll be able to run the following
command, and get the according help ouptut:

    h5bp --help

To start a new build, cd into html5-boilerplate repo and run:

    h5bp

    # which is similar to `h5bp default`

It'll create two build folders:

* `intermediate/`: used as a "staging area", will include original files
  and concat'd ones.
* `publish/`: build results, will include the whole optimized website,
  with revved assets, concat'd / minified scripts and stylesheets, and
  html files and templates with references replaced.

If you'd like to trigger the build script in watch mode, you may want to
run this command instead:

    h5bp watch

The default configuration will watch for changes for `js/*.js` and
`css/**` files and rerun the default task whenever these watched files
change.

The reload task is a slight variation of the watch task. It'll spawns up
a local http server, watch for file changes, rerun the default task and
emit back to any connected clients an event which triggers a full page
reload.

## Grunt basics

Grunt is a really nice build tool based on node. It has some built-in tasks such as:

 * **concat** - Concatenate files.
 * **init** - Generate project scaffolding based on user input.
 * **lint** - Validate files with [JSHint][jshint].
 * **min** - Minify files with [UglifyJS][uglify].
 * **test** - Run unit tests with [nodeunit][nodeunit].
 * **watch** - Run predefined tasks whenever watched files change.

[jshint]: http://www.jshint.com/
[uglify]: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/
[nodeunit]: https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit

In addition to that, we can define our own. Actually, the h5bp build
script does this while still relying on the built-in ones that grunt
provides.

### Project configuration

Build scripts based on grunt are configured through a file usually named
`grunt.js` in the current working directory.

This is used to setup the configuration for each defined tasks (built-in
or custom). More information may be found in [grunt's
readme](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/README.md), pretty
cool stuff can be used in there, namely
[directives](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/README.md#directives).

Here is a small snippet of grunt's readme related to project configuration.

> Each grunt task relies on configuration information defined in a
> single `config.init()` call in the gruntfile. Usually, this
> information is specified in task-named sub-properties of a main
> configuration object. It's not as complicated as it sounds.

> For example, this simple configuration would define a list of files to
> be linted when the task "lint:files" was run on the command line like
> this: `grunt lint:files`.


    config.init({
      lint: {
        files: ['lib/*.js', 'test/*.js', 'grunt.js']
      }
    });

Be sure to check out [grunt's
readme](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/README.md) for more
informations.

### Tasks

The default task will run the following tasks:

* **intro**: Kindly inform the developer about the impending magic.
* **clean**: Wipe the previous build dirs.
* **mkdirs**: Prepares the build dirs.
* **concat**: Concatenate files. *(built-in)*
* **css**: Concats, replaces @imports and minifies CSS files.
* **min**: Minify files using UglifyJS
* **rev**: Automate the revving of assets and perform the hash rename
* **usemin**: Replaces references to non-minified scripts / stylesheets

In addition to those tasks, which are the backbone of the build script,
there are a few additionnal tasks to help you in the process:

* **serve**: Spawns up a basic local http server (on both pubilsh /
  intermediate folder with different ports).
* **connect**:  Spawns up local http sever with socket.io configured,
  it'll inject a tiny client side script + socket.io lib on `*.html`
  response.
* **reload**: Alias for `connect watch:reload`.

You may find a slightly more detailed documentation for each tasks in
the [`tasks/`
directory](https://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script/tree/master/tasks#readme).

##### Notes

Following are rough notes and may be layout in gh issues as well.

**questions, things to be clarified**

* Wraps grunt into an `h5bp` binary ?
* Two main ways to get things done
    * regular build script with grunt configs and `intro clean mkdirs concat css min rev usemin manifest` tasks.
    * Using jsdom to avoid configuration as much as possible, and guess what to do from dom parsing.
    * How to layout these? Should be one the default, and recommended over the other one?

**todo**

* manifest task needs to be implemented
* css imports inline needs to be improved (by picking up necessary code from r.js css optimization for instance, I know that it works pretty well, with nested path support)
* Overall build script needs to be tested, and those tests need to be automated
* img optimization needs to be (re)implemented: jpeg/png opt via necessary tool (optipng/jpegtran) + rev img

**todo ++**

Following goes beyond what the current build script does, but can be worth investigating / implementing.

* Inline `<script\>` tags under a specific size
* Embed images as DataURIs into CSS
* Optionally create a MTHML file for IE6/7
    * (cssembed / jamit do this really well). The node code to to that is pretty simple, what it's not is the support for IE6/7 which require MHTML instead (cssembed / jammit can generate both).
    * maybe a good balance to serve optimized (in term of assets embedding) to all brothers, but serve the unoptimized version to IE6/7.
* do the revving (hash renames) for Images/SWFs/Fonts too.

* That's certainly not for everyone, but...
    * Prefixes relative urls with an absolute value for using a CDN

* Cleans up @VERSION@ in assets (or any global script replacement to do)
* Removes JS Logging
* ... and maybe something else I forgot?
